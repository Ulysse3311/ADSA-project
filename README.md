# ADSA-project
Advanced Data Structure and Algorithm ESILV project

This was the final project of the Advanced Data Structure and Algorithm for the 1st semester of 4th year at ESILV in the major Data and Artificial Intelligence.
We were in teams of two, and I worked with Tristan Darrigol (github.com/UnicornRules)

The project was in 4 parts, mainly about data structures and graph theory.
The differents exercices are described in ADSA_MiniProblem.pdf
You can read our code in the Jupyter Notebook All parts.ipynb
You can read the final report in Project_Berthet_Darrigol_DIA2.pdf
